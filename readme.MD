This is the README.md file. Except it's still called readme.MD. This was just a test - Visual Studio Code didn't pick up on the name difference, Git didn't see it as two different files, although bash does. And GitHub now recognizes it as a README.md file, but still lists it as readme.MD. Strange. :)
